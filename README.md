# WepApp-bookmarker built with Node/Express backend
The original project is based on Brad Traversy [Bookmarker project](https://youtu.be/DIVfDZZeGxM) on YouTube.
As always, Brad encourages his viewers to make the project their own and I have done that by implimenting this app with a Node/Express Backend. The original project with updated ES6 syntax is in the vanilla-js branch.
