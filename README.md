# WepApp-bookmarker
This is a simple application for creating a list of bookmarks and storing them into the Webstorage API using localstorage.

For my purposes, I did this project with VanillaJS. No Jquery or any kind of libraries or frameworks. 

## Ideas to add to this project
1. Adding code that will check if a URL already exists and alerting you that bookmark already exists.
2. Instead of using JavaScript Alerts, using the modal system Bootstrap provides.
