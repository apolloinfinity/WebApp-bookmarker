# WepApp-bookmarker built with Node/Express backend
The original project is based on Brad Traversy [Bookmarker project](https://youtu.be/DIVfDZZeGxM) on YouTube.
As always, Brad encourages his viewers to make the project their own and I have done that by implimenting this app with a Node/Express Backend.

## Ideas to add to this project
1. Adding code that will check if a URL already exists and alerting you that bookmark already exists.
2. Instead of using JavaScript Alerts, using the modal system Bootstrap provides.
